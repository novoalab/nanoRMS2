# NanoRMS2

NanoRMS2 is a pipeline for detection of DNA/RNA modifications. 
It requires two samples that differ in modification status, for example KO and WT.

The pipeline consists of three steps / modules:
- **get_features**: retrieve & store features in BAM file
- **predict_mods**: train ML models for modified bases, estimate per-position stoichiometry
  and much more...
- **encode_mods**: predict & encode per-read modification status in BAM file
  using ML models generated by predict step. 

All these steps can be run separately or as a pipeline by executing `nanoRMS2/run`.
